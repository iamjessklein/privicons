An open source privacy and security icon set 

# about
Over the past few months I have been wishing that there was a pack of icons that I could use whenever I was working on privacy or security related designs. I started to write down a short list of the icons that I wished were available and then writing - led to doodling - doodling led to mocking up - and mocking up led to sharing. I have never made an icon set so this was new territory for me.
